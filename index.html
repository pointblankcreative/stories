                    I cannot say enough about the outstanding care I received for both of my hip replacement surgeries at the South Campus Hospital in Calgary. From my surgeon and anesthesiologist to the nurses and nursing aides to the porters who wheeled me around to the physiotherapists who walked with me and my walker, I was in amazing hands throughout my stay. It breaks my heart that these amazing professionals are put under such careless strain by any conservative government, UCP or otherwise, for whom "public good" has become a four-letter word. We will lose these quality professionals, as has happened in the past to other, wiser jurisdictions who better recognize what a treasure they are. Hopefully, it will not
                    come to that in the end.

                        A family member had a serious bicycle accident when he was visiting friends out of town. He ended up going to hospital
                        by ambulance and once at the hospital, he was seen by specialists and diagnostic procedures were completed. When I
                        arrived, I was so grateful to see how well he was being taken care of. When he was released from the hospital, we were
                        contacted by the specialists he needed to see for follow up care. I am very grateful that the healthcare system was
                        there when we needed it. The hospital was busy but, the staff ensured we were kept informed every step of the way.

                    After working at the University of Alberta for 22-1/2 years, I was let go in March 2021. This was not anticipated and
                    came with very little notice. I had a call/zoom meeting in the morning and by noon was unemployed. I was dumbfounded and
                    went into a deep depression. I knew there were funding cuts, but thought my position would remain safe as I was employed
                    for so long. The funding cuts are too drastic and no one is safe. I was completely devastated and it took a toll on my
                    health. To ask the health care system and universities to make such drastic cuts is ridiculous. Patients and employees
                    mean nothing. We are just a number and nobody cares.

                    Recently had to take a trip via ambulance to the Stollery hospital. I could not believe the amount of families, the wait
                    time was 9 hours long. We left by 6 hours in as my child was feeling a bit better. The triage nurse was so helpful and
                    was able to give him some medication such as advil to comfort him. There are not enough beds due to budget. Terrible
                    shame but nurses and doctors continue to care for people.

                    I had two surgeries last year for kidney stones. The first one was a shockwave treatment and it was my first surgery
                    ever at 37 years old. I was absolutely terrified of going under general anesthesia and was crying before the procedure
                    and a nurse came over to find out what was wrong. She explained that for this specific procedure I'd only need to be
                    under twilight sedation, meaning I'd still be awake and could talk if needed. She was so kind and reassuring and I felt
                    so much better. Nurses are amazing!

                    Currently working in a front line role and I have never seen the system as bad as it is today. I am deeply concerned
                    about the fact that many citizens in the area we serve truly do not know the risks we face on a daily basis in terms of
                    ambulance coverage. 14 ambulances waiting in a parking lot means we are short on the road..... how does this shortfall
                    get corrected? Rural areas already in short supply are brought in..... We are chasing our tails instead of immediate
                    action being done. Your paramedics are trying their best... but very soon you may not have us as many are feeling the
                    effects and are burning out!

                        My 102 year old mother suffered a stroke in the middle of May at her home. The EMS took her by ambulance to the RDRH
                        emergency. She waited in the ambulance for 5 hours, while we waited in our car, for her to be admitted to emergency in
                        the hospital. No beds. No nurses. Understaffed. Overloaded beyond its capacity. Ridiculous situation.

                After my late husband was diagnosed with Stage IV cancer, he frequently got pneumonia. The hospital did everything they
                could to keep him with us for as long as they could.
                
                When he was too sick to go home for Thanksgiving, the hospital cafeteria opened up just for us to have our family
                Thanksgiving dinner there for free. We brought our own food, they provided all the dishes and silverware we needed. It
                was his last Thanksgiving feast, a great time was had by all.

                    I was hit by a car crossing at a crosswalk and was brought to the U of A Emergency by EMS. All around, the staff were
                    incredible. From the paramedics that took care to even pick up the AirPod that flew out of my ear and stayed by my side
                    while waiting for triage to the ER nurse that was so gentle with the IV (I don't do well with needles!) that I didn't
                    feel it. I was fully expecting to receive a bill in the mail for the ambulance ride but one never came. This is what is
                    so important - to keep healthcare public and barrier free for everyone.

                    My father went through years of mental health challenges and addiction to pain medication triggered by a permanent injury from a workplace accident. The medical professionals and programs staff he saw treated him like human, not a transaction or a burden. I advocated for him and they listened. Health care is about humans, not business or profits.

                    I broke my leg in a motor vehicle accident. I spent 4 days in hospital and had my leg surgically repaired. Because I was bedridden (immobilised from hip to toe until post surgery), I was entirely at the mercy of staff, even to go to the toilet. The nursing staff was amazingly compassionate while I was so vulnerable. I was assigned a social worker and an occupational therapists who ensured I knew how to use the crutches and that I got all the necessary tools for my recovery.

                    I was put on an intensive multi-month physio plan until I was fully healed up and ready to go back to my physical job. I
                    had publicly-funded vehicle insurance and they covered all of this plus a wage replacement that meant I could still pay
                    my bills.

                    I tore my calf muscle badly a few years ago. The emergency staff did an amazing job explaining to me what happened, how it happened and what I needed to have a full proper recovery. I was provided an ultrasound in short order to see how bad the injury really was. I recovered fully and could not be prouder of our Public Health Care professionals in Canada and to live in a country where everyone has the same access to excellent, timely services regardless of their wallet size.

                    The birth of my second child didn’t go as planned. I got scared and suddenly felt like I couldn’t do it. The team of
                    nurses, the midwife and other medical and support staff never let me feel alone for even one second. They were my
                    strength when I felt like I had none. They had my back 100% of the way. They were my team. The physical, medical and
                    emotional support they gave me that day brought a beautiful life safely into the world. I get tears thinking about
                    them.
